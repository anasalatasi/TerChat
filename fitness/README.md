# Time Behavior Documentation

This document outlines the time behavior of our messaging system based on load testing results.

## Load Test Results

### Test Case 1: High Load

- Total Requests: 10000
- Number of Threads: 10
- Success Rate: 100.00%
- Total Time: 148.32 seconds
- Requests per Second: 67.42
- Max Response Time: 3.5194 seconds
- Average Response Time: 0.0476 seconds
- Standard Deviation of Response Time: 0.1840 seconds

### Test Case 2: Moderate Load

- Total Requests: 1000
- Number of Threads: 10
- Success Rate: 100.00%
- Total Time: 11.33 seconds
- Requests per Second: 88.22
- Max Response Time: 1.0582 seconds
- Average Response Time: 0.0358 seconds

## Analysis

1. **Scalability**: The system demonstrates excellent scalability, maintaining a 100% success rate even under high load (10,000 requests).

2. **Performance under Load**: 
   - Under high load (10,000 requests), the system processes about 67 requests per second.
   - Under moderate load (1,000 requests), the system processes about 88 requests per second.

3. **Response Time**: 
   - High Load: Average response time is approximately 47.6 ms.
   - Moderate Load: Average response time is approximately 35.8 ms.

4. **Concurrency Handling**: The system effectively handles concurrent requests in both test cases.

5. **Degradation under Load**: There's a decrease in requests per second as the load increases, indicating some performance degradation under higher loads.

6. **Response Time Variability**: The high load test shows a standard deviation of 184.0 ms, indicating some variability in response times.

## Conclusions

- The system maintains high reliability (100% success rate) across different load levels.
- Performance is better under moderate load compared to high load in terms of requests per second.
- Average response times are very good, with both high and moderate loads showing sub-100ms response times.
- There's still room for optimization to improve performance under high load and reduce response time variability.
- The max response times (3.5194s for high load, 1.0582s for moderate load) suggest occasional spikes that could be investigated.
- Further testing with varying thread counts and request volumes could provide more insights into optimal configuration.
