# Time Behavior Documentation

This document outlines the time behavior of our messaging system based on load testing results.

## Load Test Results

### Test Case 1: High Load

- Total Requests: 10000
- Number of Threads: 10
- Success Rate: 100.00%
- Total Time: 148.67 seconds
- Requests per Second: 67.26

### Test Case 2: Moderate Load

- Total Requests: 1000
- Number of Threads: 10
- Success Rate: 100.00%
- Total Time: 3.90 seconds
- Requests per Second: 256.38

## Analysis

1. **Scalability**: The system demonstrates good scalability, maintaining a 100% success rate even under high load (10,000 requests).

2. **Performance under Load**: 
   - Under high load (10,000 requests), the system processes about 67 requests per second.
   - Under moderate load (1,000 requests), the system processes about 256 requests per second.

3. **Response Time**: 
   - High Load: Average response time is approximately 14.87 ms (148.67 seconds / 10000 requests).
   - Moderate Load: Average response time is approximately 3.9 ms (3.90 seconds / 1000 requests).

4. **Concurrency Handling**: The system effectively handles concurrent requests in both test cases.

5. **Degradation under Load**: There's a noticeable decrease in requests per second as the load increases, indicating some performance degradation under higher loads.

## Conclusions

- The system maintains high reliability (100% success rate) across different load levels.
- Performance is significantly better under moderate load compared to high load.
- There's room for optimization to improve performance under high load conditions.
- Further testing with varying thread counts and request volumes could provide more insights into optimal configuration.
